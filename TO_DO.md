Overall Requirements:
- class in src
- a package that implements the required functions
- A README
- <10 min runtime
- tests for package, and test coverage >80%
- pylint score > 8.0

 Specific Requirements:
 - develop steady state blade element momentum model to predict aerodynamic performance of WT
 - model to compute key performance metrics: power output, thrust, torque as functions of WS, rotor speed, blade pitch angle
 - 

 
 Write a function to load, parse and plot the provided dataset in inputs, 
generate at least one figure. Ideally also with test in tests

 â€¢ Think about the structure/architecture of your package.
