Workflow:

1. pull
2. write in chat: what am i gonna work on
3. create feature branch, not theo-branch, specific to what youre gonna work on
4. When something works and there is like a natural pause, commit and push. Commit: write clearly what you did
5. pull request for that specific thing you did
6. write in chat: please pull it
7. write in chat: status so far
8. optional: keep working on something else/new, and then the workflow reiterates.
